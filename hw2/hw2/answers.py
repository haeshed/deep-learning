**Your answer:**


High Optimization Error refers to a model failure to fit the training data well. 
Indicates issues with the training process or model complexity being too low. <br>
We can observe 93.7% accuracy on the training set, which is a good indication of a low optimization error. <br>
Altough, We have not thorouly tweaked the hyperparameters of the model, so we could potentialy get better results.<br><br>

High Generalization Error refers to a model that fits the training data well but fails on new, unseen data. 
Indicates overfitting or issues with data distribution. <br>
We can observe 92.4% accuracy on the validation set, which is a good indication of a low generalization error. <br>
We can also compare the test and validation sets, which exemplify close results, thus we can say the 
generelization has mostly succeeded.<br><br>

High Approximation Error refers to model fundamental inability to capture the underlying data patterns/distribution.
Indicates the need for a more complex model or better features.
We also know that the datasets are not sampled from the same distribution, which can lead to high approximation error. <br>
Lastly, we can observe the boundry of the model, which is not perfect, but is fairly good, and can be improved by tweaking the hyperparameters.<br><br>

"""

part3_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**

The noise in the generatad data has no tendency to affect FPR/FNR, as the noise is random and does not have a specific pattern. <br>
The other difference is that the rotation given to the data is not random, and has a specific pattern,<br> which can affect the model's performance. <br>

In our case, we can predict that the rotation will affect mostly the false classification of the 1 class (orange) as 0 class,<br>
 because of the structure of the data and the type of rotation. <br> Therefore, we can predict that the FNR (falsly classifying the 0 class) will be higher than the FPR. <br>


"""

part3_q3 = r"""
**Your answer:**


The Question presented to us is that of minimizing the risk of death while also minimizing financial costs. 
We have an opportunity to tweak the HP of the model, such that we control the tradeoff between the two risks. <br>
This really depends on the risks posed from the advanced diagnostics vs the risks posed from not testing at all (and relying on late diagnostic). <br>
With those considerations in mind, we can choose a threshold that will consider those risks and the costs associated with testing (and potentially costs of death). <br>
Without knowing the exact costs and risks, we can't give a definitive answer, so for now the optimal threshold will have to suffice. <br><br>

In the case of 1., if we can rely over non-lethal late symptoms (instead of actual testing), then we can shift the threshold to a value which will lower the costs of testing (more false negatives). <br>
In the case of 2., where high probability of death is associated with late diagnostics, we need shift the threshold to a value which will lower the risk of death (more false positives). <br>
